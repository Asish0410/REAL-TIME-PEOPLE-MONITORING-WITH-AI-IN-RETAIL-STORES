# REAL-TIME-PEOPLE-MONITORING-WITH-AI-IN-RETAIL-STORES-
This project is an AI-powered system for real-time people monitoring in retail stores. It uses computer vision (YOLO + OpenCV) to detect, count, and track customers, providing insights like footfall, dwell time, and store heatmaps. The system improves operational efficiency through queue management and staff planning, while also enhancing safety by monitoring occupancy and detecting anomalies. All data is stored and visualized on dashboards to support real-time decision making.
